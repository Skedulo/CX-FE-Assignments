## Overview

Hi! Welcome to the Skedulo CX frontend assignment project. You will see we have 3 questions and each of their instructions are located in the local INSTRUCTIONS.md. Please complete these exercises then save to a private github repository. Once you're ready reach out to your hiring manager and they will share some github names to add as collaborators who will review your submission.

Once you have completed all exercises it would be great to see a readme that contains some of your thinking while working through the test, constraints you worked within, some decisions and compromises you needed to make, and anything else you think would be interesting for the reviewers to know.

- Question 1 - React input example
- Question 2 - Problem solving
- Question 3 - Responsive CSS design

Good luck! And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact your hiring manager.

## What we're looking for ?

The purpose of the test is not only to make the solution workable, but also it has very well documented and structured code, as it serves as an example of how serious the developer is to push the team to write quality code.

- Need to code best practices and code design.
- **_You should use only plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, NO 3rd party libraries, only Bootstrap, React & Jest are allowed._**
- Main code function is one big function, it needs to be split to be more readable and maintainable.
- A readme that discusses your approach, anything that you think would be valuable for the reviewer to know
