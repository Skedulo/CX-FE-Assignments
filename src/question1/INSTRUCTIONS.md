# Question 1

## For this question we want you to setup a page with a text field that we can use to get a list of github users that having matching names.

So first we need a input box that will be a live search field. Typing anything into this field will begin the fetch of data from the server. However, it should not fetch any records until at least 3 characters have been entered. Clearing this field should clear the list of results.

We also need a loading indicator that will show up while the app is fetching results from the server.

And finally when the results are displayed we will need to see:

* List github users
* Each user has avatar, name and theirs repos_url

## What we're looking for

The goal of Question 1 is to see how candidates think through form submissions and what scenarios a user is likely to encounter whilst ensuring future maintainability of their solution.
