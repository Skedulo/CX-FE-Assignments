# Question 2

## In this question, we want you to a function (using ES6) that union all overlapping items and produce an array of non overlapping items.
For example:
- Input:
unavailableItems = [
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 30 },
  { startPx: 20, endPx: 40 }
]
- Output:
ouputItems = [
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 40 }
]

## What we're looking for

- Candidate's prorgram works properly
- A readme that discusses your approach, anything that you think would be valuable for the reviewer to know
- What testing strategy you apply to ensure your program works correctly
