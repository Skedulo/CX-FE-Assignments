# Question 2

## In this question, we want you to do a function that unions all overlapping items and produces an array of non-overlapping items, this question requires the unit test.

For example:

- Input:

```
[
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 30 },
  { startPx: 20, endPx: 40 }
]
```

- Output:

```
[
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 40 }
]
```

## What we're looking for

- Candidate's program works properly
- What testing strategy you apply to ensure your program works correctly
