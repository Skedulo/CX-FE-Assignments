# Question 3

## In this question, we want a build a pages list number of Github users, they are displayed as list cards. When we click on one card, it display a full details of user and user's projects.

### Some must have functionality includes:

- List user display as Card in left column
- Main workspace will display selected user information and list projects.
- The layout should always be the full width and height of the viewport, the whole page should never scroll.
- Both main columns should scroll independently and only vertically when filled with content.
- It must well display on both mobile screen and PC screen.

## What we're looking for

Question 3 is our test to see how people approach CSS and styling of an application. Here we're looking to see how our candidates can deliver a solution similar to the Page Layout using a CSS solution on top of any rendered cards that they think they need.
