# Question 2

## In this question, we want you to a function that union all overlapping items and produce an array of non overlapping items and unittest for it.

For example:

[
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 30 },
  { startPx: 20, endPx: 40 }
]
```

- Output:

```
[
  { startPx: 50, endPx: 90 },
  { startPx: 10, endPx: 40 }
]
```
